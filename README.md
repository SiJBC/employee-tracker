# employee-tracker

The application utilized user input to change the sql queries to interact with the database.

Begin the application by opening the folder in the console and type in:
1. npm install 
2. npm start

The user is prompted with the choice from the following array:

What would you like to do ?  


                "View all employees",
                "View all employees by role",
                "View all employees by department",
                "Add employee",
                "Add role",
                "Add department",
                "Update employee role",
                "Update employee Manager",
                "Delete employee",
                "Delete Role",


Some prompts will require a confirmation as they will alter large amounts of columns in the database

A bonu part of the project the application should include calculate the department budget based on salaries but I was unable to complete this due to time restraints.
